Here's a fun thought experiment: What if everything we think we know about expertise is about to become hilariously wrong?

Not in the obvious "AI will take our jobs" way - that's so 2023. I'm talking about something weirder: the complete collapse of our professional superiority complexes. You know, those carefully constructed towers of knowledge we've built our careers on? They're starting to look suspiciously like elaborate pillow forts.

Think about it. We've spent decades creating increasingly byzantine systems of professional certification, specialized knowledge, and industry expertise. Lawyers who pride themselves on knowing exactly which semicolon to place in a contract. Engineers who can recite database optimization patterns in their sleep. All very impressive, until you realize we've basically been memorizing really complicated patterns and calling it wisdom.

But here's where it gets interesting: As AI gets better at replicating expertise, we're discovering that most of our "expert knowledge" was just pattern recognition wearing a fancy suit. The truly valuable bits of human intelligence turn out to be the things we're so good at, we don't even realize we're doing them.

The market hasn't caught up to this yet. Everyone's still playing the old game of "how do we automate the obvious stuff?" Meanwhile, the real revolution is happening in our blind spots. It's not about making legal work 10x cheaper - it's about discovering that half of what lawyers do isn't really "law" at all, but rather an intricate dance of human psychology that we've never properly named.

The punchline? The next wave of billion-dollar companies won't be built by those who can best automate existing expertise. They'll be built by those who can identify and package the parts of human intelligence that are so fundamental, we haven't even bothered to document them. It's like trying to explain to a fish what water is - we're so immersed in these capabilities, we've never had to think about them.

We're not just changing how work gets done - we're about to discover that much of what we called "work" was just an elaborate way of compensating for our inability to explain things properly to computers. And now that computers are getting better at reading between the lines, we might finally have to admit that we don't understand our own expertise nearly as well as we thought we did.

Welcome to the expertise bubble. Turns out most of our professional knowledge was just really good cosplay all along.
