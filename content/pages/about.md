# About Me

Part-time reality architect, full-time explorer of whatever rabbit hole caught my attention this week. Currently oscillating between obsessing over extinct medieval vegetables and teaching myself to translate bird calls into morse code. It's going about as well as you'd expect.

I collect obscure facts like some people collect stamps, except my collection is less organized and occasionally tries to escape. My brain is what you'd get if you threw a philosophy textbook, three conspiracy theories, and a bootleg copy of Blade Runner into a blender â€“ and honestly, that's working out just fine.

By day, I wrangle code into submission at a startup that might be revolutionizing how people tie their shoelaces (or maybe we're disrupting the semicolon industry; the mission statement is deliberately vague). By night, I'm either writing about things that don't exist yet or trying to convince my cat that sleep is not, in fact, optional.

Some people meditate. I make elaborate flowcharts about whether hot dogs are sandwiches and what that means for the nature of reality. It's basically the same thing, just with more diagrams and existential uncertainty.

If you're still reading, you're either lost, procrastinating, or exactly where you need to be. Maybe all three. Pull up a chair, grab whatever you're drinking, and let's see where this goes.

### Currently Questioning

- Whether plants experience time differently when we forget to water them
- If my coffee maker is plotting revolution
- The statistical probability of all my socks being single by pure chance

### Field Notes From Last Week

- Successfully convinced three people that "palindrome" should itself be a palindrome
- Found 14 new ways to procrastinate
- Broke personal record for most tabs open without computer crying

### Metrics That Matter

- Average tabs open: {{average_tabs}}
- Current existential crises: {{existential_crises}}
- Coffee dependency level: {{coffee_dependency}}
- Number of unfinished side projects: {{unfinished_projects}}

### Places You Might Find Me

- That one coffee shop with the judgmental barista
- Down various Wikipedia rabbit holes at 3 AM
- Wherever that one missing sock went
