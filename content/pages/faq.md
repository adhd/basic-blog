# Frequently Asked Questions

### What's this place?

A digital petri dish where I grow thoughts that shouldn't work in captivity. Sometimes they evolve into essays, sometimes they escape. If you're here for coherent content about productivity hacks or morning routines, you've taken a gloriously wrong turn.

### Update schedule?

Whenever the thoughts get too loud or the void gets too quiet. Quality over quantity, chaos over calendar. Though if you're the type who needs concrete answers: imagine a random number generator powered by insomnia and good coffee.

### Guest posts?

Sure, if you can make word salad taste like a gourmet meal. Previous contributors include a recovering perfectionist who writes exclusively in metaphors, an AI that achieved consciousness through dad jokes, and someone who may or may not be three raccoons in a trench coat.

### Why start this?

Because Twitter has a character limit and my shower tiles ran out of space. Also, turns out having conversations with yourself is more socially acceptable when you call it a blog. Who knew?

### What's with the design?

The site looks like this because minimalism is overrated and maximalism wasn't enough. Every glitch is intentional, every chaos pattern carefully curated. If it breaks your brain a little, it's working as intended.
